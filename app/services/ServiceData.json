India has a coastline around 7500 km of which 5700 km coastline belongs to the main land while rest includes the coastline of Andaman & Nicobar group of islands and Lakshadweep.",

Geotubes are used so as to avoid harming effects of wave action, by placing them one after another creating a wall near to the location to be protected. Geotube is flexible system made up of high strength woven geotextile sheets that are filled with sand at specified pressure and flow rate by dredging from sea."
